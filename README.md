# Job Listings with Filtering

This project is a job listing application that allows users to filter job postings based on various criteria. The project is developed using Next.js, TypeScript, React, SCSS, and Tailwind CSS for styling.

## Features

- **Job Listings:** Users can view a list of job postings with detailed information.
- **Filtering:** The project includes filtering options that allow users to filter job listings by categories such as role, location, and type.
- **Responsive Design:** The application is designed to be fully responsive, adapting to various screen sizes.
- **Interactive UI:** Features interactive elements like filter buttons and responsive design components.

## Technologies

- **Next.js:** A React framework that enables server-side rendering and static site generation.
- **TypeScript:** A statically typed superset of JavaScript that improves development efficiency and code safety.
- **React:** A library for building user interfaces, especially single-page applications.
- **Tailwind CSS:** A utility-first CSS framework for rapid UI development with a focus on responsive design.
- **SCSS:** A CSS preprocessor that provides advanced styling features for better organization and maintainability.

This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/tree/canary/packages/create-next-app).

## Getting Started

First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
# or
pnpm dev
# or
bun dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

You can start editing the page by modifying `app/page.tsx`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.

This project uses [`next/font`](https://nextjs.org/docs/basic-features/font-optimization) to automatically optimize and load Inter, a custom Google Font.
